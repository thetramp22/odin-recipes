    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chicken tortellini Alfredo recipe is a hearty, cheesy, and comforting weeknight meal! It's easy to make and ready in about 25 minutes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (9 ounce) package refrigerated cheese tortellini</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>3/4 cup heavy/whipping cream</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1.5 cups cooked chicken (I used rotisserie) shredded</li>
        <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil a salted pot of water and cook tortellini according to package directions.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, when the tortellini is not too far away from being cooked, start the sauce. Add the butter to a skillet over medium-high heat. Once it's hot, sprinkle in the flour and let it cook for about a minute (stir it).</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Add the chicken broth and lemon juice to the pan and start whisking it to dissolve the flour (do this for about 30 seconds or so).</li>
        <li>Pour the cream in and add the garlic powder. Continue whisking until you've got a smooth sauce. Let it reduce for a minute or two or until desired thickness is reached. If the sauce becomes too thick, add a bit more cream or chicken broth.</li>
        <li>Stir in the parmesan. Season with salt & pepper as needed. Add in the chicken and drained pasta. Toss to let it heat through, then serve and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
