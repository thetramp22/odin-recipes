    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A simple weeknight curry with plenty of depths and yet relatively few ingredients.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Tbs. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium white onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 Tbs. finely minced ginger</li>
        <li>1 Tbs. garam masala</li>
        <li>2 tsp sweet paprika (smoked would be fine, too, if you want that slight smokiness)</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>1 rotisserie chicken, shredded</li>
        <li>2 (14.5 oz) cans diced tomatoes (with their juices)</li>
        <li>1 (8 oz) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken stock</li>
        <li>1/2 cup coconut milk (maybe a little more here if you want extra sweetness)</li>
        <li>1 Tbs. fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>fresh cilantro for garnish</li>
        <li>white basmati rice and/or naan for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, heat the oil over medium-high. Add the onions, garlic and ginger; saut√© for a minute or two, until the onions begin to sweat, and everything is so fragrant you begin to weep. Add the garam masala, sweet paprika and cinnamon stick. Toss to combine. Add the shredded chicken and toss it all together to coat.</li>
        <li>Then add the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, chicken stock and coconut milk. Partially cover and reduce the heat the medium-low. Simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, while you make the rice and/or bread. I made both because I have zero carb self control, and I'm okay with that. (fish the cinnamon stick out about 10 minutes into the simmering. or leave it in! totally your call.)</li>
        <li>After half an hour, taste it. Oooooo! Add the lemon juice and a pinch of salt and pepper, if you feel it needs it. Garnish with lots and lots of cilantro and serve with the rice and bread. And extra lemon wedges! Always always.</li>
    </ol>
