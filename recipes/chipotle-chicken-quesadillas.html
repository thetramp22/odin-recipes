    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These quesadillas are filled with gooey melted cheddar, shredded chicken and a smoky chipotle-tomato sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large red onion, chopped (about 1½ cups)</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>⅓ cup minced chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (you'll need about 6 chilis)</li>
        <li>4 vine-ripened tomatoes (about 1¼ pounds), seeded and diced</li>
        <li>3 scallions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>2½ cups cooked shredded chicken (white and/or dark meat)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>6 10-inch diameter flour tortillas</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>Sour cream, for serving (optional)</li>
        <li>Lime wedges, for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Chicken Mix</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large sauté pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until soft, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and cook 1 minute more.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chipotle peppers and tomatoes. Cook until most of the liquid from the tomatoes has evaporated and the mixture is thickened, stirring often, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the scallions, honey, chicken, salt and cilantro. Keep warm.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Quesadillas</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a sauté pan over medium heat and spray lightly with nonstick cooking spray. Lay a tortilla in the pan and heat until hot to the touch but not crisp (air pockets may form).</li>
        <li>Flip the tortilla over, then sprinkle ⅔ cup of the cheese evenly overtop, being careful to keep it off the pan. Spread a generous ½ cup of the chicken mixture over half of the tortilla.</li>
        <li>When the cheese is mostly melted, fold the tortilla over to cover the filling and form a half-moon shape. Cook until the tortilla is crisp and golden and the cheese is melted, adjusting the heat as necessary, a few minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining tortillas. Let the quesadillas rest a few minutes to allow the filling to set, then cut into wedges. Serve with sour cream and lime wedges, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
